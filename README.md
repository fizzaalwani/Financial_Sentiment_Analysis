User ML and Deep learning concepts like LinearRegression ,Linear SVM, Naive Bayes,ANN , RNN, LSTM
For NLP(ML & ANN):
Cleaned the data and removed stopwords(using nltk library), punctautions, etc
Used Lemmatization
For vectorization Ive used Tfidf and Bag of words
For NLP(RNN,LSTM):
Used numeric Embedding and RNN Embedding layer(semantic analysis)
For Evaluation:
Evaluate the current models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, ANN, LSTM) comprehensively using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices for each class.

Future Goals:
Using word2Vec
